            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PUBLISHER TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THIS Treatise I received by a Trader from <hi>New-England</hi> from an unknown hand (a Learned <hi>Nonconformist</hi> there, as I guess him to be.) I had not time to have the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of some judicious Divine here (for a number of them was desired to be sent this Season into those parts) therefore I have adventured to print it on my own Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and tho I will not presume to be a competent judg, yet I may say this, that it is a brief, smart, and (I hope) a true History of the darkness of Popery, the first Rise of the Reformation, and the great struggles for further Reformation ever since; and all this made good by
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:93774:3"/> the Writings of many Divines of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Printer having left room at the latter end, I thought good to add a Sheet which I received from a Reverend Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which I hope will not offend the Author of this Treatise, in as much as it may be use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the Reader to convince him that there are some conformable Divines, even at this time, that heartily desire and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor after Union and Communion with all the faithful in the Land, whether <hi>Conformists</hi> or <hi>Nonconformists;</hi> the Church of <hi>England</hi> having in her Articles given this definition of a Church, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The visible Church of Christ is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of faithful Men, in which the pure Word of God is preached, and the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments be duly administred according to Christ's Ordinance, in all those things that of necessity are requisite to the same.</hi> I leave the Reader to make the Inference.</p>

            <p n="1">Â§. 1. WE have seen a <hi>great</hi> RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VOLUTION, and we are e're long to see a <hi>greater.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are very considerable <hi>Questions,</hi> which do, and will, and cannot <hi>but</hi> exercise the minds of good Men in the English Nation. To assist agreeable <hi>Answers</hi> unto those considerable <hi>Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> there can scarce any more significant thing be offered, than an incontestible <hi>Idea</hi> and <hi>History</hi> of the REFORMATION. And one is here brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exhibited, which the consenting Pens of <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable Writers</hi> in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> all along here quoted, have rendred incontestible.</p>
            <p>You have here a relation and a description of a <hi>marvellous Matter,</hi> whereof I may say, as <hi>Austin</hi> once did of another Matter, <hi>Quisquis non videt, caecus: Quisquis videt, nec laudat, ingratus: Quis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis laudanti reluctatur, insanus:</hi> Those Men are <hi>blind</hi> and <hi>mad</hi> who do not acknowledg it. But the Reader is thereupon surprised with a further Advice of this importance: <hi>Believest thou? Thou shalt see yet greater things than these.</hi> And when his courteous patience hath carried him to the end of this little Treatise, he will see upon what Authority this Expectation is with so much freedom uttered; he will see that it is no <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticism.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:93774:5"/>Â§. 2. And now, <hi>Reader,</hi> be willing to travel so far into <hi>Antiquity,</hi> as to take a view of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, whereinto the <hi>Christian Church</hi> was fallen by the <hi>Apostacy,</hi> which, as the Spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ long before <hi>expresly</hi> foretold, was to come upon it. When the <hi>Imperial</hi> and <hi>Heathenish</hi> Power once flourishing at <hi>Rome,</hi> which hindred the <hi>Revelation</hi> of that <hi>wicked one,</hi> was <hi>taken out of the way;</hi> and in the <hi>fourth</hi> and <hi>fifth</hi> Century, the fierce Nations of the <hi>Northern Barbarians</hi> made their violent Assaults upon the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> and carried all before 'em, with an ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resistible Inundation of <hi>Desolation; Then</hi> a <hi>little Priest</hi> had opportunity to establish himself with a <hi>mixt Religion</hi> among those <hi>barbarous Nations,</hi> and then there appeared openly in the <hi>Temple of God</hi> that ANTICHRIST, who calls himself (what indeed the very name ANTICHRIST most <hi>properly</hi> signifies) The <hi>Vicar of CHRIST.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Antichrist,</hi> or the <hi>Satanical Spirit,</hi> working in the <hi>Bishop of</hi> Rome, was <hi>conceived</hi> as early as <hi>twenty five</hi> years after the Ascension of our Lord, in affectations of <hi>Ecclesiastical Prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency,</hi> when the Apostles accordingly gave no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of him; and he was compleated about <hi>six hundred</hi> and <hi>sixty six</hi> years after this, when <hi>Image-Worship</hi> was effectually pressed by the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar</hi> of the Western <hi>Babylon,</hi> with the ruin of the <hi>Iconoclastick</hi> Emperors that refused it. But between those Terms, even about the year 450, there were no less than <hi>ten</hi> Soveraign Kingdoms, which, taking advantage from the Confusions whereinto the Empire was fallen,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:93774:5"/> set up for themselves; and according to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Oracles, when those ten <hi>Kingdoms received their Power, then,</hi> even in that ONE HOUR, there got into the Throne the <hi>Antichristian Beast,</hi> unto whom it may be the <hi>Spirit of Prophecy</hi> had some respect in the most antient Writings of the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> which mention the <hi>Leviathan.</hi> From the <hi>Shipwreck</hi> of the <hi>Empire</hi> there were quickly gathered <hi>Planks</hi> to patch up that <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick,</hi> which they since call St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s <hi>Bark:</hi> a crafty <hi>Clergy</hi> under one <hi>spiritual Monarch,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the <hi>Conquerors</hi> of the <hi>Pagans,</hi> from whom they had been <hi>conquered;</hi> obtruding upon them a <hi>Christianity</hi> disguised with <hi>Paganism,</hi> and a <hi>Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of Daemons,</hi> with a mighty Lerry of <hi>Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> and Austerities of <hi>forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from Meats,</hi> to render the <hi>Cup of their Abomination</hi> the more inebriating. Thus the <hi>deadly Wound</hi> giv'n to the <hi>Fourth Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy</hi> was healed; the <hi>Dragon</hi> that inspired it under its <hi>Heathen</hi> form, did now no less inspire it under its <hi>Christian;</hi> and the faithful People of God were not mistaken in those days, in their Conjectures upon the <hi>Signs of times,</hi> when <hi>Rome</hi>'s falling into the <hi>Gothic</hi> hands, caused them to expect and exclaim with <hi>Jerom. He that hindred is now taken out of the way; ANTICHRIST is at hand! Gregory</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> had no sooner proclaimed it, in these memorable words of his twenty eighth Epistle, <hi>Because</hi> ANTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CHRIST, <hi>that Enemy of the Almighty,</hi> IS NOW AT HAND â <hi>I speak it boldly; whoever calls himself, or desires to be call'd by others, The</hi> UNIVERSAL BISHOP, <hi>is the</hi> FORE-RUN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NER
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93774:6"/> OF ANTICHRIST. But <hi>Boniface</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> coming a few Months after him, obtained from the Traitor <hi>Phocas (Obtinuit mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nÃ¢ tamen contentione,</hi> saith <hi>Platina</hi>) The Title of THE SOVERAIGN AND UNIVERSAL BI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SHOP.

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:93774:11"/> the time of</hi> Sylvester, <hi>and others in the time of the Apostles; and because they who are of it, have a great shew of Piety, live vertuously before Men, believe rightly of the Deity, and observe all the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Creed.</hi> The Friar <hi>Belvedoras,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusing the <hi>Missionaries</hi> for their not converting so much as one of the <hi>Waldenses,</hi> when they were sent among them, assigns this Reason for it; <hi>The Heresy is too firmly rooted there, for any to be able to do good among them; they of the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys have been always, and through all times ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted Hereticks.</hi> That sort of People call'd <hi>Waldenses,</hi> whose Errors, as <hi>Cascini</hi> the Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciscan Friar declares, consisted in this, <hi>That they denied the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>to be the Holy Mother-Church, and would not obey her Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:</hi> These, for the condition they submitted unto, were call'd <hi>the Poor Men of</hi> Lions: In <hi>Dauphine,</hi> they were nicknamed <hi>Chaignards:</hi> From the Country of <hi>Albie,</hi> where their opinions much obtained, they were called <hi>Albigenses: Tramontani</hi> were those called that passed the <hi>Alps:</hi> In <hi>England</hi> they were called <hi>Lollards,</hi> from one <hi>Lollard,</hi> a chief Instructer of them there; and strict Laws were there made against the <hi>Conventicles</hi> of those that had this name applied unto them; [<hi>Quaere,</hi> Whether ever yet repeal'd?] In <hi>Italy</hi> they were called <hi>Fratricelli,</hi> or <hi>Men of the Brotherhood,</hi> from their <hi>brotherly</hi> way of living with one another: In <hi>Germany</hi> they were call'd <hi>Gazares,</hi> a word that carries the <hi>highest Cursedness</hi> and <hi>Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> in the signification of it: In <hi>Flanders</hi> they
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:93774:12"/> had the name of <hi>Turpelins,</hi> that is to say, <hi>Men dwelling with Wolves,</hi> because the heat of <hi>Persecution</hi> sometimes drove them to seek for quarters among the <hi>wild Beasts</hi> in the <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness.</hi> This People were still disposed in sundry parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> with Circumstances no better than those which we have newly seen; Abbot <hi>Joachim,</hi> as their <hi>Quarter-Master,</hi> providing for them. They were always de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised, always distressed, always under hatches: When they made any Figure, the bloody Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which cannot any more cease bloodily to persecute the Church of Christ, than the <hi>Leopard can change his Spots,</hi> quickly thundred out barbarous <hi>Croisados</hi> against them; in one of which <hi>Crosaidos</hi> alone, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himself with triumph relates, there were killed no less than an hundred thousand; and <hi>Perionius</hi> avers, that in <hi>France</hi> alone by one Persecution upon this People, there were no less than ten hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thousand murdered. When such terrible Dissipations were overwhelming the Churches of our Lord abroad, it pleased him in the <hi>fourteenth Century</hi> to bless our English Nation at home, with our memorable <hi>Wickliff,</hi> who sounded the alarm of <hi>Reformation</hi> louder than any that had been before him; he being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed especially by the Works of the godly and learned <hi>Robert Grosthead,</hi> set himself to decry the <hi>Pope</hi> as the very <hi>Antichrist;</hi> and that men might be rescued from the Snares of <hi>Popery,</hi> he not only <hi>preach'd</hi> and <hi>wrote</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the villanies of the <hi>Popish Clergy,</hi> but
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:93774:12"/> also translated the whole <hi>Bible</hi> into the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Language;</hi> whereby those Impressions were made on the minds of Men that never could be totally effaced.

            </p>
            <p n="4">IV. There is a <hi>Catholick Church</hi> which is a <hi>Mystical Society,</hi> purchased and purified by the <hi>blood</hi> of the Lord Christ, and married unto him, and possessed by his Holy Spirit; part of this <hi>Family</hi> of God is, in conjunction with the holy Angels, arrived unto perfect Holiness in <hi>Heaven;</hi> part is on <hi>Earth,</hi> in the sure way unto it. But the <hi>Apostate Church</hi> confines to it self the Notion of the <hi>Catholick Church;</hi> it is a <hi>Society</hi> whereto not one inward and sincere Grace of Christianity is requisite; a visible profession of subjection to <hi>Romish Canons,</hi> is all that is required unto the Constitution of that <hi>Society;</hi> 'tis a wicked thing, by cursed Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments compounded for a secular Domination,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:93774:14"/> that anathematizes all that conform not unto the Superstitions of it; and a <hi>Moloch</hi> which horribly devours the <hi>Children</hi> cast by the Ghostly Fathers into its devouring Flames.</p>
            <p n="5">V.

But the <hi>Apostate Church</hi> cannot see any comliness in the <hi>Spouse of Christ</hi> as adorned only with his Graces: in the place thereof they have brought in worldly <hi>Grandeurs, Dignities, Promotions;</hi> and the <hi>Glories of this World,</hi> which our Saviour would not accept at the <hi>Devil's hands,</hi> and on the <hi>Devil's Terms,</hi> in his Temptations, the Devil has proffer'd unto this Man of Sin, and he has accepted of them.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. The <hi>Church</hi> is a Body which must have an Head, both for <hi>Influence</hi> and for <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> always present with it: And it is a wonder how Men could think of any other Head for this Body, besides the Lord <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> without casting away their <hi>Bibles.</hi> But the <hi>Apostate Church</hi> have set up another <hi>supream Head of the Church,</hi> even the <hi>Pope,</hi> the worst Idol that ever was heard of: One Pope re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scinds the Decrees of another, and it may be throws the Carcase of his Predecessor into the River; yea, <hi>Wretches</hi> which even their own Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries in their most allowed Histories call <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,</hi> and such as for their Diabolical Practices,

            <p n="7">VII. The <hi>Discipline</hi> which our Lord has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his Church to observe, must be such as to serve the Designs of <hi>Holiness,</hi> and shew unto Mankind the <hi>Love, Care</hi> and <hi>Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of the Lord himself towards the Church, and give a Testimony and <hi>Praeludium</hi> of his <hi>future Judgment;</hi> all of an <hi>Efficacy</hi> purely spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual.

'Tis a principle of our blessed Religion, that God the <hi>Sovereign Lord</hi> of all things, is to be obeyed <hi>absolutely</hi> and <hi>universally:</hi> His Will is to be the highest Reason of our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. But the <hi>Apostate Church</hi> has superceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this, by imposing upon Men a <hi>Vow of blind Obedience to their Superiors,</hi> urging for that Vow the Example of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Obedience: And thus all the Interests of Men lie at the Mercies of a spurious Offspring, the most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural

            <p n="13">XIII.

Reader, In these troubles at <hi>Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> there was the <hi>Epitome,</hi> and in some sort the <hi>Original</hi> of the struggles about <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> both <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con,</hi> which have ever since distressed the Church of God in the English Nation: until at length a <hi>new England</hi> was found out, as a <hi>refuge from the storm</hi> of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptural <hi>Impositions</hi> urged with unnatural <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions.</hi> From the very beginning of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> there hath always been a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Godly Men, desirous to pursue the <hi>Reformation of Religion, in Doctrine, Worship, Discipline and Government, according to the word of God, and the example of the best Reformed Churches:</hi> and there hath been another Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Men who have employed the <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> which they have still generally had in their hands, not only to <hi>stop</hi> the progress of the desired <hi>Reformation,</hi> but also with innumerable vexations to persecute those that were the most hearty friends unto it. All Mankind knows that among those who jointly forsook the <hi>Papacy,</hi> there were <hi>different apprehensions</hi> about the <hi>Worship</hi> and <hi>Order</hi> to be maintain'd in the Church; and we have no <hi>Record</hi> of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:93774:22"/> any <hi>attempt</hi> for the healing of these <hi>differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> before there was by <hi>Law established</hi> one certain <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Worship</hi> and <hi>Order;</hi> which thro the pertinacious adherency not only of <hi>most People</hi> unto their <hi>old ways,</hi> but even of the <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Clergy,</hi> the greatest part of whom disliked the <hi>whole Reformation;</hi> and through the extreme scarcity of <hi>able Minis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> underwent as little alteration from the former Usages as was possible. This <hi>Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution</hi> of things was very dissatisfactory to very many of the <hi>best Men</hi> in the Land; who yet considering the <hi>necessity of the Times,</hi> did more or less acquiesce in it, hoping and plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the <hi>Reformation</hi> might proceed in <hi>due time</hi> unto more of <hi>Purity:</hi> but they that found their own <hi>secular Interests</hi> accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated in this <hi>Constitution,</hi> set themselves after a while to fine, silence, deprive, censure, and imprison those that were dissatisfied, and <hi>smite their Fellow-Servants,</hi> who remained in <hi>privacy</hi> under their Sufferings, waiting still for more of <hi>Reformation. Thus</hi> Edom <hi>refused to give</hi> Israel <hi>passage through his Border, wherefore</hi> Israel <hi>turned away from him!</hi> After some years of a fruitless <hi>expectation,</hi> the severities which were multiplied upon them drove mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes unto a more open <hi>separation</hi> from the things that were by <hi>Law established:</hi> a <hi>sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> which yet was opposed by others that also passionately longed and even groaned for a <hi>National Reformation.</hi> Tho not being wholly agreed among themselves about the <hi>measure</hi>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:93774:23"/> of <hi>Separation</hi> or of <hi>Reformation</hi> to be attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto, there insued several Inconveniencies thereupon which had no little <hi>Temptation</hi> in them. <hi>Then</hi> 'twas, that, as our great <hi>Owen</hi> has expressed it, <hi>Multitudes of pious, peaceable Protestants were driven by their Severities to leave their Native Country, and seek a Refuge for their Lives and Liberties, with freedom for the worship of God in a Wilderness, in the ends of the Earth.</hi> There are none that more heartily bless God for the <hi>first Reformers,</hi> and for the service they did in the <hi>Reformation,</hi> or that more firmly cleave to their <hi>Doctrine</hi> which was the <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Soul</hi> of <hi>Reformation,</hi> than these <hi>Non-conformists</hi> have ever done, or that more try to follow them in their <hi>noble design.</hi> But, as those <hi>first Reformers</hi> never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that what <hi>they</hi> did should be the <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute boundary</hi> of <hi>Reformation,</hi> from whence it were a sin to dissent or depart, which would have been to have only changed <hi>one Popery</hi> for another, and quite contrary to their own going beyond <hi>Wickliff,</hi> and <hi>changing</hi> and <hi>grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> in their own <hi>models</hi> also, and the inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous Confessions of the great <hi>Cranmer</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, who <hi>fatchatur multa detracta oportere superflua, &amp; ardentibus votis cupiebat ea in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius correcta;</hi> And the Orders of King <hi>Edward</hi> unto <hi>Bucer,</hi> to write for further Amendments, whom accordingly we find in his Learned <hi>Scripta Anglicana</hi> doing so; thus the <hi>Non-conformists</hi> have been willing to imitate them in exercising that <hi>Liberty wherewith Christ hath
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:93774:23"/> made them free.</hi> This is very sure, that those very <hi>Principles</hi> upon which the <hi>first Reformers</hi> built the <hi>Reformation,</hi> are those that have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced and justified the hundreds of thousands of <hi>Non-conformists</hi> which have so long asked for further steps to be taken in it; namely those <hi>Principles,</hi> that the Word of our Lord Jesus Christ is a <hi>perfect Rule</hi> of all that we are to believe or practise in <hi>Religion:</hi> and, that <hi>Christian People</hi> not being tied up to the blind obedience of their <hi>Ecclesiastical Guides,</hi> are to judg <hi>for themselves</hi> what they are to believe or to practise in <hi>Religion.</hi> 'Tis very sure also, that the <hi>Non-conformists,</hi> in imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Challenge made by Dr. <hi>Jewel,</hi> one of our first <hi>Reformers,</hi> unto the <hi>Romish</hi> Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, upon their unjust imputation of <hi>Novelty</hi> unto the <hi>Reformation,</hi> have published a <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge</hi> in such Terms as these.</p>

The God of Heaven having sent the light of the <hi>Gospel</hi> into the Minds of the <hi>King</hi> and some that were his chief Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, disposing them to the <hi>Reformation,</hi> they found it a business incredibly difficult for them to incounter the inveterate and incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable prejudices with which Mankind were ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally possessed, against the work by them desired and intended. The greatest part of the greater Men, the <hi>Nobles</hi> and the <hi>Gentry,</hi> were averse to the proceedings of the <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers;</hi> the most of the <hi>Clergy</hi> were so true unto their own carnal Interests, that with <hi>might</hi> and <hi>main</hi> they opposed those Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; and the body of the <hi>People</hi> horribly blinded with Superstition and Prophanity, were easily <hi>Priest-ridden,</hi> to join with their <hi>blind Leaders</hi> in their troublesom oppositions: Nor were the Nations in the Neighbourhood left uninstigated by the <hi>Pope,</hi> to foment the discontents of the People on this occasion. The body of the People were those which in these difficulties the King most of all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, knowing, that they were his <hi>Wealth</hi>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:93774:24"/> and <hi>Strength,</hi> and that without <hi>their</hi> concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence the Dissatisfactions of all others would hurt none but themselves. Now the People in those days being miserably unacquainted with the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the Scripture, were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little or nothing at all concerned, what perswasions Men held in matters of pure <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,</hi> provided they might retain those <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Modes</hi> in their <hi>Worship,</hi> whereto they had been accustomed. Accordingly we know, that the <hi>Prelates</hi> who carried on the <hi>Papal Persecution</hi> against the <hi>Reformers,</hi> rarely, if ever, unless compelled by Disputations, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned the <hi>Opinions</hi> about the <hi>Credenda</hi> of <hi>Doctrine,</hi> as the grounds of the Quarrel, tho these were the <hi>main grounds</hi> of all; because the <hi>common People</hi> would not have been easily prevailed withal, to bring in Faggots for the burning of their Brethren on those more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struse accounts: but it was in the <hi>agenda</hi> of <hi>Worship,</hi> that they wisely stated the cause of all their Cruelty, because they saw that the <hi>common People</hi> would violently interpose on the behalf of the <hi>Mass,</hi> wherein their <hi>share of Religion</hi> chiefly lay.</p>
            <p>Our considerate <hi>Reformers,</hi> considering the disposition of the <hi>People,</hi> first of all, with a brave Resolution, asserted the true <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the Gospel, and renounced the Errors and Follies with which the <hi>Antichristian Apostacy</hi> had envenom'd it: but then they <hi>attempered</hi> the way of public <hi>Worship</hi> as far as ever the Articles of their <hi>Faith</hi> would permit them

               <hi>(if no further)</hi> unto that which the <hi>Populace</hi> had been us'd unto. It was a thing very sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible unto them, that so long as ths People were accommodated with as much conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as might be unto their former <hi>customs</hi> in <hi>Divine Service,</hi> the main <hi>Reformation</hi> in <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi> which ('twas hop'd) would at length introduce a <hi>Reformation</hi> in <hi>Worship</hi> also, might go on with less <hi>Observation,</hi> and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with less <hi>Contestation.</hi> And the Priests find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>provision</hi> thus made for their continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in the possession of their Places, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any thing further prescribed, but what was as easy to be performed as any thing that had been practised in former days, would quietly let their betters go on with what they had undertaken. On these considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the English <hi>Liturgy</hi> was formed, and the Book of <hi>Common-Prayer</hi> thus composed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came from the very beginning a <hi>bone of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention</hi> in the Church of God.

A mutual agreement in bearing with one another's Dissents in the Non-fundamentals of Religion, is really a greater Ornament, than the most exact Uniformity imaginable; it being an eminent exercise of Charity, the Flower of all Christian Graces, and the best way I think at the long-run, to make the Church as uniform as can justly be desired.</q> To have done: Such was Mr. <hi>Chillingworth,</hi> whose emphatical Words are these; <q rend="margDblQuotes">Require of Christians only to believe Christ, and to call no Man Master but him only; let those leave claiming of Infallibility, who have no right unto it, and let them that in their words disclaim it, disclaim it like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in their Actions: In a word, take away Tyranny, which is the Devil's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument to support Errors, and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitions, and Impieties in the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parts of the World, which could not otherwise long withstand the Power of Truth; I say, take away Tyranny, and restore Christians to their just and full liberty of captivating their Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to the Scripture only; that universal Liberty thus moderated, may quickly reduce <hi>Christendom</hi> to Truth and Unity.</q>

            <p>On the other side; there hath been a prevailing Party, whose Grief it hath been, that ever the <hi>Reformation</hi> proceeded so far, and whose Wrath hath been on all occasions vented against the Memory of those that were chief in the <hi>Reformation.

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:93774:51"/> who said, <hi>We had rather lose a Ceremony than a Soul.</hi> As is said of some Meats, <hi>Neither if we Eat them are we the better, nor if we Eat not are we the worse;</hi> so we are nothing bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by these <hi>Ceremonies.</hi> And the Reason for the use of the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> ceaseth much; they were kept partly out of Compliance with the <hi>Papists</hi> to gain upon <hi>them,</hi> but now the <hi>Papists</hi> are harden'd by it, upbraiding us (as Bishop <hi>Usher</hi> said of them) <hi>If our Flesh be not good, Why do you drink of our Broth?</hi> And the <hi>Conformists</hi> (many of them) would think it hard to be <hi>Silenc'd</hi> for not Assenting to the <hi>Perseverance of the Saints,</hi> or any other the <hi>Five Points,</hi> according to the common Sense of our <hi>Dissenting Brethren.</hi> â I shall conclude with the common Assertion of the <hi>Reformed Churches,</hi> That all <hi>Churches</hi> should labour as much as possibly may be, after <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical Simplicity,</hi> and fewness of <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> which they judge the safest, the purest, and the best; as <hi>Peter Martyr, Bucer, Calvin, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za, Zanchy,</hi> and indeed almost all Good men affirm.</q>

            <p>It was in the Year 1690, that one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable Divine [whose Name, I hear, is Mr. <hi>Graves</hi>] Published a Discourse on the <hi>Vanity, Mischief, and Danger of continuing Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies in the Worship of God:</hi> And now see what he says; <q rend="margSglQuotes">If we by continuing the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent <hi>Terms of Communion,</hi> drive People from us, the <hi>Schism</hi> will lodge at our doors, and we shall be the <hi>Schismaticks.</hi> They that for <hi>Rites</hi> labour to keep up our Animosities, make themselves Guilty of all the <hi>Persecutions of former Times;</hi> and God may charge upon them all the <hi>Righteous Blood</hi> that has been shed, from the Blood of <hi>Abel</hi> to the Blood of <hi>Russel; Verily I say unto you, it shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of this generation.</hi> â There is no keeping up the Honour of the <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> except we <hi>blind</hi> the <hi>People,</hi> which is now im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible. â Many of our own <hi>Clergy</hi> submit not unto them out of <hi>Choice,</hi> but as a <hi>Burthen</hi> from which they would gladly be delivered. â As <hi>Knowledge</hi> increaseth, <hi>Zeal</hi> for <hi>Ceremonies</hi> will grow more and more <hi>Ridiculous.</hi> â The Lords, the Knights of the Shires, and the Burgesses, know who are <hi>fit</hi> in their several Countries to be <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellors of Peace,</hi> and <hi>Healers of our Breaches;</hi> and if <hi>we</hi> are unwilling to be <hi>Peace-makers, they</hi> may (if they please) make a <hi>Law,</hi> That the <hi>Members of both Houses,</hi> shall in their several Countries, chuse Three or Four Divines to sit in <hi>Convocation</hi> to offer unto
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:93774:52"/> them, what may settle the Peace of our Church. â The <hi>Church</hi> would lose no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing though all its <hi>Ceremonies</hi> were laid aside. They are no more an <hi>Ornament</hi> unto the <hi>Church,</hi> than the <hi>Chains</hi> of a <hi>Galley</hi> or a <hi>Prison,</hi> are <hi>Ornaments</hi> to the poor man that is laden with them. â A Soul swallowed up in the Contemplations of the Infinite Majesty of the Glorious God, may reckon these imposed <hi>Fooleries,</hi> no better than the <hi>Fools-Caps</hi> and <hi>Coats</hi> which Persecutors did put on the Saints of God; they may be valued by formal <hi>Dead Christians,</hi> but the <hi>Spiritually Minded</hi> will look on them, as <hi>Toys</hi> fit only to Adorn <hi>Hypocrites.</hi> No man can shew any <hi>good</hi> they have done, except it be <hi>good</hi> to maintain a <hi>Corrupt Party</hi> in Church and State, to the excluding a <hi>Pious, Sober, Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, Diligent, Powerful</hi> Interest. <hi>Uniformity</hi> is <hi>Deformity,</hi> and Confusion, when men ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point <hi>other Terms</hi> of Ministerial Service and Church-Communion, than are prescribed in <hi>God's Word.</hi> â The good Temper, Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Diligence, Faithfulness, and Courage of God's Servants, hath been useful to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; but a <hi>Carnal Faction of Christians,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hurried by a mad Zeal for little things, have oppressed these <hi>Benefactors,</hi> stained the Glory of the Nation, beaten down the Rents of Lands, discouraged Industry, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed Trade, and brought the most Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious <hi>Island</hi> in the World, unto a low state. â The making <hi>unnecessary Terms</hi> of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterial Service, which Christ never enjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:93774:52"/> is an Invasion of his <hi>Kingly Office.</hi> â Instead of keeping out <hi>Burning and Shining Lights,</hi> we had need <hi>Trim</hi> some of our own, which give but a <hi>faint Light,</hi> if any at all. â The most Learned <hi>Divines,</hi> and the Wisest <hi>Statesmen</hi> in the World, are but Bunglers when they take upon them to add unto <hi>God's Worship</hi> what he hath not appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. â With these Inventions <hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>Atheists</hi> are habited like <hi>Christians</hi> for the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the <hi>Devil,</hi> to corrupt and destroy true <hi>Christianity.</hi> â Mankind hath for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Ages been possessed and tormented with a <hi>furious Spirit,</hi> the <hi>Devil</hi> of <hi>Impositions;</hi> it will never be well till this <hi>Spirit</hi> is cast out. â <hi>Piety</hi> hath been hid in Corners, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move <hi>Stumbling-Blocks,</hi> and it will come forth and appear in publick with all its Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Glory. â The use of <hi>Ceremonies</hi> tends to the oppression of the <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Christianity.</hi> They are like <hi>Painted Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows,</hi> which make a gaudy shew, but they much lessen the <hi>Light.</hi> â The <hi>Carnal part</hi> of the world is easily engaged for <hi>them,</hi> against <hi>Holiness;</hi> and to such a degree that <hi>serious Piety</hi> hath been scoffed at, not only by the <hi>Mobile,</hi> but even the Tribe of the <hi>Long Robe</hi> when engaged to be <hi>Advocates for Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions.</hi> â Our furious <hi>Bigots,</hi> when they had quite trampled under foot the <hi>Dissenters,</hi> they began a wild Carier against Piety and Sobriety in their <hi>own Body.</hi> The Removal of <hi>Ceremonies</hi> will take away the <hi>Vizor</hi> with which <hi>Formalists, Hypocrites,</hi> Wicked and

            <p>It was in the Year 1693.

                  <hi>Compulsion</hi> is a Quiver which affords many a sharp <hi>Arrow,</hi> but such as seldom hit the Mark. â Yet we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not go to the House of God in Company: How happy were it if the <hi>Partition Wall</hi> were broken down, or so <hi>wide a Door</hi> made in it that we might go in and out; that every thing were <hi>cut off</hi> which <hi>troubles</hi> the Church,

And I cannot understand, why the same <hi>Latitude</hi> or <hi>Charity</hi> might not be granted in the other scrupled parts of <hi>Conformity.</hi> The Church (I am of Opinion) may thank her <hi>Preferments</hi> for the extreme Zeal of many of her Votaries in the case of <hi>Conformity.</hi> The Whore of <hi>Babylon</hi> never wanted Pledgers, whenever she drank to them out of her <hi>Golden Cup,</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>Abominations</hi> 'twas filled with. â Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose some of our Tackling should be rent, and Sprucery sullied, yet it were a Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune no way comparable to that of dashing the <hi>Ship</hi> against the <hi>Rock.</hi> And what <hi>Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack</hi> the Storms which some <hi>Zealots</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us are ever upon the least Alteration of that <hi>Rigging</hi> (though upon the justest Reasons) raising, may occasion, God only knows, if he that stills the <hi>Raging of the Sea,</hi> does not quiet the <hi>Madness of the People.</hi> â Why might not things be so tempered, that the Church of <hi>England,</hi> by hearkening to some <hi>Terms</hi> of accommodation, and making a

The next Year seems in all probability to be a Year of Wonders, for the Recovery of the Church. â And I send you the News of a continual Increase of the flourishing State of the Church very shortly to begin, and to continue unto the End of the World.</hi> In fine, As the first pretended <hi>Statute</hi> that ever was in <hi>England,</hi> for the <hi>vexing</hi> of Christians on the account of Religion, by the colour whereof the <hi>Bishops</hi> committed great Oppressions and Cruelties, was one that never pass'd the <hi>House of Commons,</hi> but the <hi>House of Commons</hi> in the next <hi>Parliament,</hi> with the concurrence of the <hi>King,</hi> vehemently protested against it, albeit the then <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> with the help of the other <hi>Prelates,</hi> found a way unjustly to suppress and conceal the <hi>Revocation</hi> of that pretended <hi>Statute;</hi> so it may be hoped our Lord Jesus Christ will bless the Nation with <hi>Parliaments</hi> that shall restrain a <hi>Corrupt Clergy,</hi> not only from <hi>vexing</hi> of Christians on the account of <hi>Religion,</hi> but also from stopping any more the progress of <hi>Religion</hi> in the Nation.

            <head>The Conformists Reasons for hearing and joining with the Nonconformists.</head>
            <p n="1">1. THE same Reasons which oblige Persons to hear and join with us, oblige us also to take all Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of hearing and join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Nonconformists, they being Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of Christ, having due Call and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity from him to preach the Gospel. The Church hath real need of their Labours, their Ministry is hated by Satan and his Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; they are duly subject to the higher Powers, and are protected by the Law of the Land in the course of their Ministry, and are a considerable part of that same Church of <hi>England,</hi> which His present Majesty under God is Supreme Governor of, according to the old Oath of Supremacy, and the 37th Article of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Those Words of our Saviour's take place here; <hi>He that is not against us, is on our part, Mark</hi> 9.40. The Nonconformists <hi>really</hi> are not against us, therefore they are on our part. The Scope and Drift of their Ministry is to
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:93774:61"/> win Souls, not to this or that Sect, but to Christ; to teach them their Duty to God, and to His present Majesty, as sole Supreme under God, and the common Center of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Unity in these Nations. They are truly tender of our Ministry, rejoice in our Labours, and in the Gifts and Graces of able and faithful Conformists, rebuke Backbiters and Vilifyers of our Ministry; and as they have opportunity, some of them hear and join with us and our Churches.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In the time of the late King <hi>James</hi> the Church of <hi>England</hi> did confess its Error in being severe to the Nonconformists. This is plain from a certain Pamphlet published in the late King's Reign, entituled, <hi>A Letter to a Dissenter, upon occasion of his Majesty's late graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Declaration of Indulgence.</hi> The Words there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, <hi>page</hi> 8. are these following; <hi>The Church of</hi> England <hi>convinced of its Error in being severe to you; the Parliament, whenever it meeteth, will sure be gentle to you: the next Heir bred in the Countrey which you have so often quoted for a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of Indulgence: A general Agreement of all thinking Men, that we must no more cut our selves off from the Protestants abroad, but rather enlarge the Foundations upon which we are to build our Defences against the common Enemy; so that in truth all things seem to conspire to give you Ease and Satisfaction,</hi> &amp;c. This is to be looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as the general Sense of the Conforming Nobility, Gentry, Commonalty, and Clergy, in the time of the late King's Reign: for so really it was, as is well known. Now here
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:93774:61"/> the Church of <hi>England</hi> doth confess its Error towards the Dissenters, and to have erred not in some slight and trivial Matters, but in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters touching the Foundation; and sees a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of enlarging its Foundations, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently of taking in the Nonconformists, and making them constituent Parts of the Church with her self. Either then the Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformists are upon one and the same Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation with our selves, or they deserve to be; and it is through no fault of theirs that they are not: Being upon the same Foundation, we cannot be against their Ministry and Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, but we must needs be against our own, and overthrow the Common Protestant Cause, Religion, and Interest in this Nation, and consequently in all other Nations and Countries, what in us lies; and in being for their Ministry, we are for our own.</p>
            <p n="4">4. These Scriptures set together, prove it a Duty, <hi>viz. Hear, and your soul shall live,</hi> Isa. 55.3. <hi>Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them,</hi> Mat. 18.20. <hi>I charge thee before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, preach the word, be instant in season, out of season,</hi> 2 Tim. 4.1, 2. <hi>Though I be free from all men, yet have I made my self servant unto all, that I might gain the more: And unto the Jews I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law; to them that are without law, as without law, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not without law to God, but under the law to Christ) that I might gain them that are without
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:93774:62"/> law: To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak. I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some: And this I do for the gospel's sake,</hi> 1 Cor. 9.19, 20, 21, 22, 23.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The <hi>Communion of Saints</hi> is a principal Part of the Catechism, and of the common Creed of <hi>Christendom;</hi> it is a Fundamental in true Religion, most frequently repeated in all Conforming Congregations. Now we do not duly believe and practise this Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, unless we hear and join with the Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conforming Brethren in the Word, and Prayer, d Sacraments, as we have Call and Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, they being visible Saints, and there being nothing in their way of Worship, but what is either laudable or tolerable: God doth own and approve their Ministry and Meetings, and is graciously present with them.</p>

The Dissenters refuse Subjection to the Governors of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and therefore it cannot be safe for us to hear and join with them. <hi>Answ.</hi> This is plainly not true; for under God His present Majesty is sole Supreme Governor of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> ruling all Estates according to Laws enacted by common Consent in Parliament; witness the old Oath of Supremacy, and the 37th Article of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in these words, <hi>The King's Majesty hath the chief Power in this Realm of</hi> England, <hi>and other his
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:93774:62"/> Dominions. Unto whom, the chief Government of all Estates of this Realm, whether they be Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical or Civil, in all Causes doth appertain, and is not, nor ought to be subject to any Foreign Jurisdiction.</hi> The Dissenting Ministers gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally subscribe this Article; and it is notorious that they are duly subject to His present Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, pray heartily for him, pay Taxes, bear all legal Charges, and are more upright and cordial to the present Government, than many of the Conformists are. If you deny His present Majesty to be chief Governor of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> you then bring in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, and unhinge the Government.</p>

Though the King be Supreme Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor by the Sword, yet Bishops are Supreme Governors of the Church of <hi>England</hi> by the Word. <hi>Answ.</hi> Bishops have no Authority but what is ministerial and subordinate, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they cannot be Supreme Governors: They are under Law to God, and they are under Law to the King as God's Vicegerent. If you suppose them Supreme Governors of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> you suppose them Popes, that is, Antichristian Prelates, exalting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves above God, and above the King his Vicegerent. <hi>Abiathar</hi> the High-Priest was not Superior to, nor Co-ordinate with King <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> but his Subject, and therefore for his Crime was justly deposed by him, and <hi>Zadock</hi> put in his room.</p>

The Dissenting Ministers have not just and valid Ordination, as being Ordained by meer Presbyters without a Bishop. <hi>Answ.</hi> God hath no where declared that there cannot be just and valid Ordination without a Bishop, and therefore the contrary Doctrine must needs be Erroneous. Accordingly all true Protestants own and approve Ordination by Presbyters without a Bishop, (as is used in the <hi>Dutch, Helvetian, French,</hi> and <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> Churches) to be just and valid, and not defective in any thing absolutely necessary. The Church of <hi>England</hi> doth not allow the Ordination of Presbyters by a Bishop only, without the presence and concurrence of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>assistant Presbyters, who do equally Impose Hands with the Bishop: And the Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans do not allow Ordination by all Presbyters promiscuously, but only by Senior Presbyters, such as for their Age, Experience, Gravity, Wisdom, Ministerial Ability and Fidelity, and exemplary Vertues, are Heads and Chief Men among them, and a kind of Fathers to the Younger Sort, The principal thing in a Minister of Christ, is not External Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but Ministerial Ability and Fidelity; Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Ordination is not principal but subser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient: And where is Ministerial Ability and Fidelity, with the consent and liking of the People, and the protection and countenance or permission of the Magistrate, with Imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Hands, and Fasting and Prayer by Senior Ministers of known Wisdom, Gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:93774:63"/> Piety, and exemplary Vertue and Ability; either this is just and valid Ordination, or there is no such thing as Ordination, neither can it be declared what it is. Now this is the Ordination in use among the Dissenters. And indeed able and faithful Presbyters are, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Scripture-phrase, Bishops; <hi>Acts</hi> 20.17, 28. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.1. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.1.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 4. We who are Conforming Ministers cannot hear and join with the Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists without breach of our Oath of Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Obedience to the Ordinary. <hi>Answ.</hi> That Oath binds us but to obey the Ordinary in things lawful and honest: And to hear and join with the Nonconformists as we have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, is neither against Law nor Honesty, but rather laudable, pleasing to God, profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Soul, and the true way of Peace. The Ordinary is not Supreme, but an Officer appointed by the King and State touching Church-matters, he is under Law to God, and to the King and State: If he enjoin or forbid us any thing contrary to Law, we owe him no Obedience. Our Oath to him binds us to no new Duty, but only binds us more strictly to do what we had been bound by the Law to do, in case we had not taken that Oath. The same Supreme Authority which makes the Ordinary, and gives him limited Power over us, doth declare in the Preamble of the late Act for Toleration, that the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty now enjoyed by the Nonconformists, <hi>may be an effectual means to unite His Majesty's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:93774:64"/> Subjects in Interest and Affection.</hi> Now our hearing and joining with the Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists, is a countenancing of them, and of their present Liberty, and consequently it tendeth to the Union of Protestants in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest and Affection, in the Judgment of the King, and of both Houses of Parliament, and consequently of the Ordinary himself; for by the Ordinary is meant the Bishop of the Diocess, who is one of the House of Lords, and so hath a hand in making the Law. How can we disobey the Bishop by hearing and joining with those Men, unto whom the Bishop himself, as a Member of the House of Lords, doth by his consent to the Act of Parliament, give free Liberty, as an effectual means of uniting Protestants in Interest and Affection, and exempteth them from all Penalties, and from being prosecuted in any Ecclesiastical Court, for or by reason of Nonconforming to the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land?</hi>

                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 5. The Nonconformists are against all Church-Government by Bishops; and there can be no Church without a Bishop. <hi>Answ.</hi> The Nonconformists are not against all Church-Government by Bishops, for they have long desired that famous Archbishop <hi>Usher</hi>'s Model of Church-Government by Bishops and Presbyters might be established among us. But hitherto they could not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it, for there are a Party of Men in the Nation, some Clergy and some Laity, by
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:93774:64"/> Profession Protestants, whom the Piety and Moderation of such Bishops as Bishop <hi>Usher</hi> and Bishop <hi>Hall,</hi> doth greatly offend, and can by no means please. A limited Episcopacy the Nonconformists generally are not against; try and see if they will not accept and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly Conform to Archbishop <hi>Usher</hi>'s Model. That there may be a Church without a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, is plain from the <hi>Dutch, Helvetian,</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant <hi>French</hi> Churches, and those in <hi>New-England.</hi> There is also the universal Church on Earth, and yet no one universal Pastor and Bishop on Earth. The Pope indeed claims to be so, but for that he is by Protestants justly charged with Antichristian Pride and Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. There is also the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as comprising all the Christian People in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> but no one Man is universal Bishop to all the Christian People in <hi>England,</hi> nor are all the Bishops put together Governors of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but they are subject to the King, and Governed by Laws made by the King and Parliament, as hath been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared; and therefore it is not true that there can be no Church without a Bishop. The Church consisteth by Christian Faith, Hope, and Love, not as exclusive of Pastors and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, but as supposing and including them as God's Instruments for begetting and finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing these heavenly Graces: And nothing hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders but that able and faithful Presbyters may be instrumental in God's Hands for begetting and finishing these heavenly Graces in thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of Souls, yea and much better than

The Nonconformists have no pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Liturgy, that is, no stinted Form of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Prayer and Administration of Sacraments. <hi>Answ.</hi> You will give the Minister leave to chuse his Text, and compose and methodise his Sermon; Why can you not also leave him to perform the other part of Ministerial Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, respecting Prayer, Thanksgiving, and the Sacraments, by a stinted Form or not, as he himself is best able and thinks most meet? If his Words be grave, sound, scriptural, pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, suited to common Edification, though not to each ones Fancy, your Duty is to mind your Heart, to purify that from Pride and carnal Prejudice, and evil Thoughts, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionately to concur and join in all the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and be thankful. It is very desirable that all Ministers were of such Abilities, and
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:93774:65"/> at all times so prompt and full, as to need no stinted Form in publick; let those who are so able, not be abridged of their Liberty beyond their own Choice and Christian Prudence. The Nonconformists keep to Christ's own Words in the Act of Baptism, and they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite the Words of Christ touching the Lord's Supper, and they keep to a stinted Form in Singing Psalms, and they read God's own Word in their Assemblies; and if they be able to Preach, they are able to Pray, and to suit their Prayer to the Edification of that People over whom they are set, and to whom they Minister. And therefore this can be no just Exception; they think they have much more reason to except against our way, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too much in stinted Forms.</p>

We who are Conformists, cannot hear and join with the Nonconformists with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out condemning our own way. <hi>Answ.</hi> It doth not follow, that because our Way is good, therefore their Way is not good; for as to external Modes, and Forms, and Things circumstantial, Sister-Churches, and Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour-Congregations may differ, and yet both be good and lawful. Twenty Ministers at the same time in distant Congregations may hit upon the same Text, and deliver the same substantial Doctrine, and yet their Words and Method and Composure may wonderfully vary, and all may be good and useful, and God more glorified by such Variety, than otherwise. Most conforming Congregations
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:93774:66"/> have no Organs; some have; must therefore one of the two necessarily be bad and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? The Churches in <hi>Holland,</hi> the Churches in <hi>Helvetia</hi> and <hi>Geneva,</hi> the Churches in <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi> and in <hi>New-England,</hi> the Protestant <hi>French</hi> Churches, have different Ways, and Modes, and Forms, as to external Worship. If one be good, must we therefore condemn all the rest as sinful? What is sinful and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by God, we may in no wise conform to; but what is neither precisely commanded, nor precisely forbidden by God, may be done or not done, according as Christian Prudence shall dictate to be most convenient: In such Cases and Matters we are after the Example of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to be all things to all Men; and if we come to an Episcopal Church, do as they do; if we come to a Presbyterian Church, do as they do; according as <hi>Ambrose</hi> advised <hi>Augustine, Ad quancunque ecclesiam veneris, ejus morem serva, si, &amp;c.</hi> To what Church soever thou shalt come, observe its way and manner, if thou wouldst neither offend others, nor have others to offend thee.</p>

If the Nonconformists will preach in the Church, I will readily hear them; but to hear them in Barns and private Houses, and the like places, I will not, I am against it. <hi>Answ.</hi> We cannot follow a better Pattern than Christ: Now he preached not only in the Temple and Synagogue, but in private Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and sometimes upon a Mountain, and by the Sea-side out of a Ship, the People standing
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:93774:66"/> upon the Shore; and he never declined Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to more or fewer in any convenient place suitable to the Occasion. The places in which the Nonconformists preach, some of them are goodly Edifices, some of them are publick Chappels, the meanest of them are not natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally indecent, they best suit with their Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances; and God being graciously present with them, the places where they assemble must needs be <hi>the House of God, and the Gate of Heaven,</hi> Gen. 28.10, to 18. Get them free leave to exercise their Ministry in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and they will willingly quit their Barns and other places; but if you exclude them from the Churches, you necessitate them to preach in other places; and by valuing the Word for the sake of the Place, rather than the Place for the sake of the Word, you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that indeed you do not truly value God's Word. As it was no Shame to Christ to be born in a Stable, nor to his Virgin-Mother, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was not their Sin but their Calamity, but all the Shame was to those that thrust them into the Stable: so it is no Shame for God's Ministers and People to worship him in a Barn, when they have no fitter Place to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship God in; but the Shame is to those that might allow them better Places to worship God in, and will not, but thrust them into a Barn, and then make that a Cloak for their not hearing and joining with them.</p>

There is no need of the Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists Preaching, it doth more hurt than good, it may better be spared, the Conformist Ministers are full enow for the People of this Land. <hi>Answ.</hi> I confess that if all Places throughout the Nation were supplied by able and faithful Conforming Ministers, as some are, there would not be such need of the Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformists Preaching as now there is; but it is manifest to all discerning and impartial Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, that though there is no want of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, yet there is great need of able, holy, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful, painful and exemplary Ministers in all the Diocesses of <hi>England;</hi> and pious Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists and Nonconformists Ministers have need of each others Labours, and the more humble and faithful they are, the more sensible of it. Never to this day did the Church over-abound with able and faithful Preachers, nor will to the end of the World, while the Followers of <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> remain in the World, and many are called, but few chosen. Good Bishop <hi>Hall</hi> would use to say, You may as well complain of too many Stars in the Firmament, as of too many good Preachers in a County.</p>

The late Act of Toleration doth only tolerate the Nonconformist Meetings, it doth not approve them. <hi>Answ.</hi> It is plain from the Preamble of the Act, that it permits them as <hi>an effectual means to unite their Majesties Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Subjects in Interest and Affection;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

The Dissenting Meetings are not true visible Churches of Christ. <hi>Answ.</hi> The 19th Article of the Church of <hi>England</hi> declares <hi>the visible Church of Christ to be a Congregation of faithful Men, in which the pure Word of God is preached, and the Sacraments be duly ministred ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Christ's Ordinance, in all those things that of necessity are requisite to the same.</hi> Now the Dissenting Meetings are visibly such Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, and therefore it is impossible that they should be heretical, schismatical, and lack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in any thing necessary to the being of true visible Churches of Christ. If we deny them to be true visible Churches of Christ, we shall not be able to prove the Conformist Churches true visible Churches of Christ; for my part I am not able, and I despair to see it solidly and scripturally proved by any other.</p>

Conforming and Nonconforming Churches are contradictorily opposite, as Light and Darkness, Christ and <hi>Belial,</hi> Heaven and Hell, and therefore both cannot be true Churches. <hi>Answ.</hi> Such as conform to God's Word, and such as do not conform to God's Word in the Substance and Foundation of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, are contradictorily opposite, as Heaven and Hell, the Church of God and the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue of Satan; but they who equally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to God s Law in the Substance and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Religion, and differ but about cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstantial things enjoined by Man's Law, though really and for the main they be both Conformists, yet verbally and <hi>secundum quid</hi> they differ as Conformists and Nonconformists; therefore the grand difference is not between Conforming and Nonconforming Protestants, but between godly and ungodly Protestants, whether Conformists or Nonconformists. As for godly Men Conformists and Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists, they can bear with one another, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice in each others Labours, and sincerely though not perfectly deny themselves, and mind and seek the things of Christ, and advance his Kingdom; but it is unregenerate, ungodly, Self-seeking, Saint-hating, sensual and worldly Men, whether Conformists or Nonconformists, that are the Plague of the Church, and Satan's chief Agents.</p>

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:93774:68"/> to them shall harden them in their sinful Nonconformity, and shall displease our own Side, and not gain our Enemy. <hi>Answ.</hi> Be it supposed that Nonconformity is a Sin, will it therefore follow that we are not to do our Duty to God and them, and all that in us lies seek the Peace of the Church and the Publick Good? Rigid Conformists confess the Points scrupled by Nonconformists, to be in their own nature indifferent, neither commanded nor forbidden by God, and that the Church may <hi>well</hi> be without them: Moderate Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists confess the Church might <hi>better</hi> be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them, if all both Rulers and People could be so content: but Nonconformists judge some of the things to be flatly sinful. Now on whom doth it lie to yield? They retaining their own Principles, cannot yield and come over to us; we retaining our own Principles, may come over to them, and join with them in the Word, and Prayer, and Sacraments, as we have Call and Opportunity; and in so doing, we gain them so far as it lies in us to gain them; we please God, which is Motive sufficient, and cannot but have a good end and effect. If they make an ill use of our Condescension, that is their Sin, for which they must answer to God, who will not fail to accept and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward our good Deed: and if Conformists be displeased with us for doing our duty, shall we therefore desist from it? The question is not, whether they sin in not conforming? but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing to each other their different Thoughts and Opinions about Conformity, what is the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:93774:69"/> duty of both sides as to mutual Peace and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord? They are so prudent as in the course of their Ministry to insist upon those Points in which both sides agree, as being sufficient for Edification; and therefore we may safely join with them in publick Church-duties as we have occasion, without receding from our own Principles, without breaking any Law divine or humane; and therefore it will lie at our door if we do not; we sin against one Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of Faith, <hi>The Communion of Saints.</hi>

Remember the Communion of Saints is an Article of Faith twice repeated in Conforming Churches each Lord's Day, and at other times.
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:93774:70"/> Let us all agree to practise this one Article of Faith impartially, and it will heal all our Breaches and Divisions: I press no one to go against his own Principles and the Dictate of his Conscience, but only in times of great Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision, and of many Sects and Parties, and contrary Ways and Interests, to be an impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Christian, and to abound in holy Love and Self-denial, and true Zeal for the Peace of God's Church in this Nation, and for the publick Good.

Judge not according to Appearance, but according to Truth: have love to your Country, value Persons by their insides.</p>
               <p>Let us remember the Day of Judgment, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly converse with our Protestant Brethren, not be strange to them, serve them in Love; rejoice that Christ is preached, Souls saved and edified, and Satan confounded by the Ministry of Protestant Conformists and Nonconformists. Long for the good Day when all Sect-names shall be abolished, and till that can be, let us really and indeed be one in Love; embrace the Nonconformists as dear Brethren in Christ, make them freely welcome to preach in our Pulpits, encourage our People to hear them,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:93774:70"/> and hear and join with them our selves as we have Opportunity, and thank them for their Labours, and wish them all good Success, and extend our Charity to such of them as need, and in all things conform our selves to the Example of Christ.
